Building a multilayer neural network using the Cats and Dogs Dataset.

UNDERSAMPLING
Undersampling: method used to address class imbalance in a dataset.
Imbalance in the sense that one class has fewer instances than the other, and the ML is not able to sufficiently predict the minority class.
- What is done: You reduce the instances of the majority class to balance the distribution <br>

Random undersampling: you randomly remove instances <br>
- Issue: lose important information or small dataset 

OVERSAMPLING
Oversampling: increasing the number of the minority class using the synthetic data generation method or ensemble methods (SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
SMOTE uses k-nearest neighbor mechanisms (come back to this).
